# **VersaPy - Build modern desktop Python apps easily**

## Introduction

<p>

VersaPy is a lightweight framework made for building modern desktop apps using a web-based frontend (with vitejs) and and integrated Python backend with PyWebview and FastAPI.

PyInstaller is used for packaging the app into a single executable.

## Test versapy:

#### To use versapy, you'll need Python >=3.9 and NodeJS installed. <br/>
#### Make sure to initialize your project in an empty directory.

You can try versapy with these commands:

```bash
npm create versapy@latest
```

This command might take a bit of time, it init the whole project.

Once done, just run with:


```bash
npm run dev
```

## About Build

#### The build function is actually reserved to windows, and will come later for linuw and macos.

You can build your project with:

```bash
npm run build
```
